# TSN Contracts

This directory contains the Kuneiform contracts used in the Truflation Stream Network (TSN).

## Contents

- `composed_stream_template.kf`: Template for composed stream contracts
- `primitive_stream_template.kf`: Template for primitive stream contracts
- `system_contract.kf`: System-level contract for managing official streams
- `contracts.go`: Go file for embedding contract contents

## Purpose

These contracts define the core functionality of the TSN, including:

- Data stream management
- Permissions and access control
- Index calculations
- Metadata handling

## Synchronization

We aim to keep these contracts in sync with the public versions in the [tsn-sdk repository](https://github.com/truflation/tsn-sdk). This private repository serves as the primary development environment.
