 * DIGEST ACTIONS MIGRATION
 * 
 * Implements optimized digest system with UNNEST batch processing:
 * - batch_digest: Direct OHLC processing with bulk operations (replaces digest_daily)
 * - auto_digest: Batch process multiple pending days using optimized batch_digest
 * - get_daily_ohlc: Query daily OHLC data from raw or digested sources

/**
 * batch_digest: Single-statement bulk processing with CTEs for maximum performance
 *
 * Implements complete bulk operations in a single SQL statement using CTEs.
 * Eliminates array ↔︎ SQL round-trips and multiple statement overhead.
 *
 * Performance benefits:
 * - Single SQL statement with all operations
 * - Zero array conversions and UNNEST overhead
 * - Relation-based joins instead of expensive anti-joins
 * - Reuses intermediate results efficiently
 * - Planner can optimize the entire pipeline
