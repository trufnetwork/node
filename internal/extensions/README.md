# TSN Extensions

This directory contains Kwil extensions to implement TSN functionality. Extensions are registered in the top-level `extension.go`. Any registered extensions will be included in the binary build process.

There are 3 extensions present here:

## Mathutil

`mathutil` provides a basic function to multiply an integer by a fraction. This allows for weighting values used within composed streams.

Below is an example of multiplying the number 100 by 4/9:

```
use mathutil as math;

action my_action() public {
	$result = math.fraction(100, 4, 9); // 100 * (4/19) = 44.444, rounds to 44
}
```

## Primitive Stream

`primitive_stream` allows any contract storing data to be turned into a Truflation primitive stream. It requires a `table_name` configuration. The `date_column` and `value_column` configurations are optional. If not provided, `date_column` defaults to "date_value" and `value_column` defaults to "value". These configurations specify the columns from which the extension will get values.

Currently, the `primitive_stream` extension should be the last operation in an action. This allows it to return responses of any size by modifying the last query result. No other SQL queries should follow this extension in the Kuneiform file.

It is capable of calculating both an index as well as a value for any date (in `YYYY-MM-DD` format). The index is the calculation described [here](<https://system.docs.truflation.com/backend/cpi-calculations/workflow/normalizing-data>). The value is simply the value for any given date.

- If empty string is passed to both dates, it will return the most recent date;
- If a date is passed to the first date, it will return the value / index for that date;
- If a date is passed to the first date and another date is passed to the second date, it will return the value / index for the range of dates.

```
use primitive_stream {
    table_name: 'prices',
    date_column: 'date_value',
    value_column: 'value'
} as primitive_stream;

table prices {
  id text primary notnull minlen(36) maxlen(36),
  date_value text notnull unique minlen(10) maxlen(10),
  value int notnull,
  created_at int notnull
}

// public action to add record to prices table
action add_record ($id, $date_value, $value, $created_at) public {
  INSERT INTO prices (id, date_value, value, created_at)
  VALUES ($id, $date_value, $value, $created_at);
}

action get_index($date, $date_to) public view {
    $val = primitive_stream.get_index($date, $date_to);
}

action get_value($date, $date_to) public view {
    $val = primitive_stream.get_value($date, $date_to);
}
```

## Composed Streams

`composed_streams` allows composing contracts that are valid Truflation streams. Any contract that has `get_index(YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-MM-DD?)` and `get_value(YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-MM-DD?)` actions is a valid Truflation stream. The logic of the stream composition is included inside the extension.

You may use any of these options as an id of a stream:

- `<wallet_address>/<stream_name>`
- `/<stream_name> (then the wallet address will be the sender of the transaction)`
- `<DBID>`

You may use any prefix to identify a stream on its key, but is important that each stream contains the suffix `_id` and `_weight`.

```
use composed_stream {
    stream_1_id: 'corn_id',
    stream_1_weight: '1',
    stream_2_id: 'hotel_id',
    stream_2_weight: '9'
} as composed_stream;

action get_index($date, $date_to) public view {
    composed_stream.get_index($date, $date_to);
}

action get_value($date, $date_to) public view {
    composed_stream.get_value($date, $date_to);
}
```

## Example

I have created and tested a basic example of composing streams together. To run this, we need to build a Kwil binary with these extensions.

The example contracts can also be found in this directory, under `example_contracts`.

### Beef, Corn, And Barley

The example uses 3 primitive streams, and creates 2 composed streams from them. The primitive streams are for beef, corn, and barley commodities.

The first composite stream combines the beef and corn stream into a beef_corn stream. The beef is weighted as 70% of the stream, while the corn is weighted as 30% of the stream.

The second composite stream combines the beef_corn stream with the barley primitive stream. It weights the beef_corn stream at 90%, and the barley stream at 10%.

### Using The Example

To use the example, build this binary using the repo README, and run the `kwild` node. Refer to the Kwil docs on [how to run a node](<https://docs.kwil.com/docs/node/quickstart>).

#### Configure your CLI

Configure your CLI by calling `kwil-cli configure` and then add the following configs:
```bash
$ kwil-cli configure

Kwil RPC URL: http://localhost:8080
Kwil Chain ID: <leave empty>
Private Key: <any-ethereum-private-key>
```

This will create a `~/.kwil-cli/config` file with the above configurations. The configuration above assumes you are running the Kwil node on your local machine. Feel free to adjust the configuration if you are running the node elsewhere. <br/>
To verify that your CLI is configured properly, you can run:

```bash
$ kwil-cli utils ping
```

#### Deploy the Primitive Streams

Once the node is running, you can deploy the contracts found in `examples`. First, deploy the three primitive streams:

```bash
kwil-cli database deploy -p=./example_contracts/primitive_stream.kf  -n=beef
kwil-cli database deploy -p=./example_contracts/primitive_stream.kf  -n=corn
kwil-cli database deploy -p=./example_contracts/primitive_stream.kf  -n=barley
```

Once deployed, seed them with some initial values. Remember that, in order to account for accuracy, we add 3 extra 0s to values. For example, 40.101 becomes 40101:

```bash
kwil-cli database execute -n=beef -a=add_record id:24c80091-a203-4182-a56b-e6891441e8aa date_value:2023-01-01 value:40101 created_at:$(date +%s)

kwil-cli database execute -n=corn -a=add_record id:24c80091-a203-4182-a56b-e6891441e8aa date_value:2023-01-01 value:4329 created_at:$(date +%s)

kwil-cli database execute -n=barley -a=add_record id:24c80091-a203-4182-a56b-e6891441e8aa date_value:2023-01-01 value:792 created_at:$(date +%s)
```

#### Deploy beef_corn Index

Once we have seeded data, we can create the beef_corn stream. To do this, edit the `composed_1.kf` stream to add in the DBID for your beef and corn streams. Then, deploy the stream:

```bash
kwil-cli database deploy -p=./example_contracts/composed_1.kf  -n=beef_corn
```

You can check that everything is working properly by getting the combined value from the beef_corn stream:

```bash
kwil-cli database call -a=get_value date: date_to: -n=beef_corn
```

#### Deploy beef_corn_barley Index

Just like in the above step, we will now use the `composed_2.kf` contract to compose the beef_corn stream with the barley stream. Edit the `composed_2.kf` to add in the dbids for the beef_corn and barley streams. Then, deploy the stream:

```bash
kwil-cli database deploy -p=./example_contracts/composed_2.kf  -n=beef_corn_barley
```

To check that it is working, we can get the value for the beef_corn_barley stream. If seeded with the values given above, this should give:

```bash
$ kwil-cli database call -a=get_value date: date_to: -n=beef_corn_barley
| result |
+--------+
|  26510 |
```
