# Testing the Gateway Locally
These files are not required to run TSN locally, however they are useful for testing the gateway locally.

## Steps
- Make sure you have downloaded the privately shared Kwil Gateway. If you have not, and need to test it, please contact the TSN team.
- Move the expected binary (linux amd) to `.build/kgw`
- Start the TSN compose file, to ensure the necessary network is created
- Start the gateway compose file with `docker-compose -f dev-gateway.dockerfile up`
- To trust the localhost certificate, run `task setup:local-cert`

## Testing
You may run `kwil-cli utils ping --kwil-provider https://localhost:443` and should receive `pong` as a response.
