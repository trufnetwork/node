# TSN Extensions

This directory contains Kwil extensions to implement TSN functionality. Extensions are registered in the
top-level `extension.go`. Any registered extensions will be included in the binary build process.

There are 3 extensions present here:

## Mathutil

`mathutil` provides a basic function to multiply an integer by a fraction. This allows for weighting values used within
composed streams.

Below is an example of multiplying the number 100 by 4/9:

```
use mathutil as math;

action my_action() public {
	$result = math.fraction(100, 4, 9); // 100 * (4/19) = 44.444, rounds to 44
}
```

## Basestream

`basestream` allows any schema storing data to be turned into a Truflation stream. It requires a `table_name`
configuration. The `date_column` and `value_column` configurations are optional. If not provided, `date_column` defaults
to "date_value" and `value_column` defaults to "value". These configurations specify the columns from which the
extension will get values.

Currently, the `basestream` extension should be the last operation in an action. This allows it to return responses of
any size by modifying the last query result. No other SQL queries should follow this extension in the Kuneiform file.

It is capable of calculating both an index as well as a value for any date (in `YYYY-MM-DD` format). The index is the
calculation described [here](<https://system.docs.truflation.com/backend/cpi-calculations/workflow/normalizing-data>)
The value is simply the value for any given date.

- If empty string is passed to both dates, it will return the most recent date;
- If a date is passed to the first date, it will return the value / index for that date;
- If a date is passed to the first date and another date is passed to the second date, it will return the value / index
  for the range of dates.

```
use basestream {
    table_name: 'prices',
    date_column: 'date_value',
    value_column: 'value'
} as basestream;

table prices {
  id text primary notnull minlen(36) maxlen(36),
  date_value text notnull unique minlen(10) maxlen(10),
  value int notnull,
  created_at int notnull
}

// public action to add record to prices table
action add_record ($id, $date_value, $value, $created_at) public {
  INSERT INTO prices (id, date_value, value, created_at)
  VALUES ($id, $date_value, $value, $created_at);
}

action get_index($date, $date_to) public view {
    $val = basestream.get_index($date, $date_to);
}

action get_value($date, $date_to) public view {
    $val = basestream.get_value($date, $date_to);
}
```

## Compose_truflation_Streams

`compose_truflation_streams` allows composing of schemas that are valid Truflation streams. Any schema that
has `get_index(YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-MM-DD?)` and `get_value(YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-MM-DD?)` actions is a valid Truflation stream.
The logic of the stream composition is included inside the extension. It's important to ensure the sum of the weights is
equal to 1.

You may use any of these options as an id of a stream:

- `<wallet_address>/<stream_name>`
- `/<stream_name> (then the wallet address will be the sender of the transaction)`
- `<DBID>`

You may use any prefix to identify a stream on its key, but is important that each stream contains the suffix `_id`
and `_weight`.

```
use compose_truflation_streams {
    stream_1_id: 'corn_id',
    stream_1_weight: '0.1',
    stream_2_id: 'hotel_id',
    stream_2_weight: '0.9'
} as streams;

action get_index($date, $date_to) public view {
    streams.get_index($date, $date_to);
}

action get_value($date, $date_to) public view {
    streams.get_value($date, $date_to);
}
```

## Example

I have created and tested a basic example of composing streams together. To run this, we need to build a Kwil binary
with these extensions.

The example schemas can also be found in this directory, under `example_schemas`.

### Beef, Corn, And Barley

The example uses 3 base streams, and creates 2 composite streams from them. The base streams are for beef, corn, and
barley commodities.

The first composite stream combines the beef and corn stream into a beef_corn stream. The beef is weighted as 70% of the
stream, while the corn is weighted as 30% of the stream.

The second composite stream combines the beef_corn stream with the barley base stream. It weights the beef_corn stream
at 90%, and the barley stream at 10%.

### Using The Example

To use the example, build this binary using the repo README, and run the `kwild` node. Refer to the Kwil docs
on [how to run a node](<https://docs.kwil.com/docs/node/quickstart>).

#### Deploy the Base Streams

Once the node is running, you can deploy the schemas found in `examples`. First, deploy the three base streams:

```bash
kwil-cli database deploy -p=./example_schemas/basestream.kf  -n=beef
kwil-cli database deploy -p=./example_schemas/basestream.kf  -n=corn
kwil-cli database deploy -p=./example_schemas/basestream.kf  -n=barley
```

Once deployed, seed them with some initial values. Remember that, in order to account for accuracy, we add 3 extra 0s to
values. For example, 40.101 becomes 40101:

```bash
kwil-cli database execute -n=beef -a=add_record id:24c80091-a203-4182-a56b-e6891441e8aa date_value:2023-01-01 value:40101 created_at:$(date +%s)

kwil-cli database execute -n=corn -a=add_record id:24c80091-a203-4182-a56b-e6891441e8aa date_value:2023-01-01 value:4329 created_at:$(date +%s)

kwil-cli database execute -n=barley -a=add_record id:24c80091-a203-4182-a56b-e6891441e8aa date_value:2023-01-01 value:792 created_at:$(date +%s)
```

#### Deploy beef_corn Index

Once we have seeded data, we can create the beef_corn stream. To do this, edit the `composed_1.kf` stream to add in the
DBID for your beef and corn streams. Then, deploy the stream:

```bash
kwil-cli database deploy -p=./example_schemas/composed_1.kf  -n=beef_corn
```

You can check that everything is working properly by getting the combined value from the beef_corn stream:

```bash
kwil-cli database call -a=get_value date: date_to: -n=beef_corn
```

#### Deploy beef_corn_barley Index

Just like in the above step, we will now use the `composed_2.kf` schema to compose the beef_corn stream with the barley
stream. Edit the `composed_2.kf` to add in the dbids for the beef_corn and barley streams. Then, deploy the stream:

```bash
kwil-cli database deploy -p=./example_schemas/composed_2.kf  -n=beef_corn_barley
```

To check that it is working, we can get the value for the beef_corn_barley stream. If seeded with the values given
above, this should give:

```bash
$ kwil-cli database call -a=get_value date: date_to: -n=beef_corn_barley
| result |
+--------+
|  26510 |
```
