# Kwil DB

The database for Web3.

## Overview

Learn more about Kwil at [kwil.com](https://kwil.com).

## Build instructions

### Prerequisites

To build Kwil, you will need to install:

1. [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
2. [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/installation)

### Build

Invoke `task` command to see all available tasks. The `build` task will compile `kwild`. They will be generated in `.build/`:

```shell
task build
```

## Local deployment

### Run Postgres

Before running the custom kwild binary, you will have to start Postgres.
The Kwil team has provided a default image with the necessary configurations. 
For more information on how to configure your own Postgres database, please refer to the [Postgres setup guide](https://docs.kwil.com/docs/daemon/installation#postgresql).

```
docker run -d -p 5432:5432 --name kwil-postgres -e "POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust" \
    kwildb/postgres:latest
```

### Run Kwild

You can start a single node network using the `kwild` binary built in the step above:

```shell
.build/kwild --autogen
```

For more information on running nodes, and how to run a multi-node network, refer to the Kwil [documentation](<https://docs.kwil.com/docs/node/quickstart>).

## Building and Using Docker Image // TODO: Rewrite me please

To build a Docker image of TSN-DB with seed data, run the following command:

```shell
docker build -t tsn-db:latest . -f ./truflation/docker/tsn.dockerfile
```

To run the Docker image, use the following command:

```shell
docker run --name tsn-db -p 8080:8080 tsn-db:latest
```

## Resetting local deployments

By default, `kwild` stores all data in `~/.kwild`. To reset the data on a deployment, remove the data directory while the node is stopped:

```shell
rm -r ~/.kwild
```
